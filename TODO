Business Analysis vs requirement engineering
  Requirement engineering:
    - systems and software engineering process
    - Targes products, not processes
      Covers:
        - discovering, documenting and maintaining a set of requirements for a computer-based system
        - functional and non-functional requirements
      Does not cover
        - business, stakeholder and transition requirements
    Focus:
      - building products
      - developing engineering specifications for a product / NOT delivering business value
    Does NOT focus:
      - business process improvements,
      - building a business case
      - delivering business benefits

    Activities:
      - Requirements development.
      - Requirements management.

    With Agile, some observers question if requirement engineering is still relevant and needed.

    Dimensional modelling

    Data sourcing is often overlooked. It is often not considered seriously. Many PMs (especially those who are not from DW background) think like “Ah it’s about getting data from finance department, easy…”
